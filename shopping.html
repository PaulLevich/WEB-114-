   <h3> 1. Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement </h3>
   <h3> 2. When comparing values,  in what data type is the result stored? </h3>
   <h3></h3>
   <h1>Answers</h1>
   <h3></h3>
   <h3>1. You need to use a "if" statement if you want to be able to differentiate the answers and output a different answer depending on what the user imputs. An example is when building a vending machine you use a "if" statement to decide if the user needs to insert more money or calculate how much change the user is given or if he has entered enough money.</h3>
   <h3>2. The data type will always return with a Boolean "true or false"</h3>
